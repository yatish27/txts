# StackOverflow

- //StackOverflow description
- //Some table regarding the statistics about StackOverFlow

# StackConnect

- StackOverflow is one of the fastest way for developers to get their questions answered.
- Instead of checking your SO inbox regularly to check for a reply for your asked question, there will be browser plugin(StackConnect) which will provide in browser notifications.
- Developer can monitor his questions, reply to comments and search for necessary terms directy from the plugin, rather than sign in to StackOverflow everytime.

# Two Approaches

+ Chrome Extesions:
    + Uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
    + Based on Greasemonkey way of building things.
    + Making changes to code requires hitting a reload button on the "Manage Extensions" to ensure that the latest code is running, which is quite handy while make changes to the many times. 
    + Basic behavior of extension is described in manifest.json file.
    + Chrome provides Chrome Developer Tools which makes debugging comparitively easy.

# Two Approaches

+ Firefox Add-ons: 
    + Uses Javascript, HTML and CSS.
    + Based on Jetpack project which provides an easy way to create add-ons for Firefox and it heavily borrows from CommonJS.
    + Jetpack extensions are actually compiled to XPI(user installable file) which would mean compiling and reloading the extension, which is a tedious task. 
    + Basic behavior of extension is described in package.json file.
    + Debugging is comparitively hard.
