# StackOverflow

+ Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.

+ Typical one day Stack Overflow usage:
    + 148,084,883 HTTP requests to load balancer
    + 36,095,312 of those were page loads
    + 833,992,982,627 bytes (776 GB) of HTTP traffic sent
    + 286,574,644,032 bytes (267 GB) total received
      

# StackConnect

- StackOverflow is one of the fastest way for developers to get their questions answered.
- Instead of checking your SO inbox regularly to check for a reply for your asked question, there will be browser plugin(StackConnect) which will provide in browser notifications.
- Developer can monitor his questions, reply to comments and search for necessary terms directy from the plugin, rather than sign in to StackOverflow everytime.

# Two Approaches

+ Chrome Extesions:
    + Uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
    + Based on Greasemonkey way of building things.
    + Making changes to code requires hitting a reload button on the "Manage Extensions" to ensure that the latest code is running, which is quite handy while make changes to the many times. 
    + Basic behavior of extension is described in manifest.json file.
    + Chrome provides Chrome Developer Tools which makes debugging comparitively easy.

# Two Approaches

+ Firefox Add-ons: 
    + Uses Javascript, HTML and CSS.
    + Based on Jetpack project which provides an easy way to create add-ons for Firefox and it heavily borrows from CommonJS.
    + Jetpack extensions are actually compiled to XPI(user installable file) which would mean compiling and reloading the extension, which is a tedious task. 
    + Basic behavior of extension is described in package.json file.
    + Debugging is comparitively hard.

  Age       Likelihood 
-------     ----------
< 18         65
18-24        133
25-34        167

Likelihood meaning:

- Index of 200~ any random user is twice as likely to be in this category
- Index of 50~ any random user is half as likely to be in this category

# Special  relativity equation

- $t' = t\frac{1}{\sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)}$
